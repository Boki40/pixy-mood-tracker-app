We use this to reproduce the error and to provide a fix.\n\n### Behavioral Data\n\nWhen you open a screen or change a setting, this will be sent to one of our analytics tools. This data is sent anonymized. None of your personal data is sent. For example, if Laura Birmingham tracks her mood. We only see that user 101029 did this action.
