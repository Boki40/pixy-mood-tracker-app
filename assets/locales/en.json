It is never shared with anyone except if you choose to export it or use the webhook functionality.\n\n### Error Logs\n\n**To find issues and maintain stability, we look at reported error logs.**\n\nWe collect error logs with the service provider Sentry. It gives us the possibility to see the time, the screen opened and the type of the device. We use this to reproduce the error and to provide a fix.\n\n### Behavioral Data\n\nWhen you open a screen or change a setting, this will be sent to one of our analytics tools. This data is sent anonymized. None of your personal data is sent. For example, if Laura Birmingham tracks her mood. We only see that user 101029 did this action. We will never collect any text you store in the app.\n\nWe use Posthog Cloud to collect and visualize data. It helps us to better understand trends and to find areas for improvement.\n\n\n---------\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, drop me a line at [moritz@devmood.com](mailto:moritz@devmood.com).\n\n**I use this app by myself and I would never want to share personal data with any developer.**\n\n*You can find the whole privacy policy here.*",
