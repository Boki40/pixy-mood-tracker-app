So let me explain how the data is used and why your data is safe.\n\n### We don’t have access to your tracked information\n\nYour data is saved locally on your device. It is never shared to anyone except you choose to export it or use the webhook functionality.\n\n### Error Logs\n\n**To find issues and maintain stability, we look at reported error logs.**\n\nWe collect error logs with the service provider Sentry. It gives us the possibility to see the time, the screen opened and the type of the device. We use this to reproduce the error and to provide a fix.\n\n### Behavioral Data\n\nWhen you open a screen or change a setting, this will be sent to one of our analytics tools. This data is sent totally anonymized. None of your personal data is sent. For example, if Laura Birmingham tracks her mood. We only see that the user 101029 did this action. We never collect any text you store in the app.\n\nWe use Posthog Cloud to collect and visualize and data. It helps us to better understand trends and to find areas of improvement.\n\n\n---------\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, drop me a line at [moritz@devmood.com](mailto:moritz@devmood.com).\n\n**I use this app by myself and I would never want to share personal data with any developer.**\n\n*You can find the whole privacy policy here.*",
